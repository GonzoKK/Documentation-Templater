	# Content
	Welcome to the Documentation Templater's example documentation. This is still WIP.

## Begin Section

	# Content
	The code for this HTML page is defined in the 'Template' folder. The actual text is added using a form of markup in the 'Input' folder. Each file in the 'Input' folder corresponds to a HTML page which will be generated in the 'Output' folder. You'll notice this HTML page was generated from the 'Contents.txt' file in the 'Input' folder.

## End Section


## Begin Section

	# Content
	To generate your own documentation, simply change the text files in the 'Input' folder, execute the 'docTemplater.exe' and you'll see the generated documentation in the 'Output' folder. If you want to change the template, you'll have to work it out yourself. I'll add documentation for this in the future.

	What if I'm using Mac/Linux?

	# Content
	You'll have to recompile the excutable for Mac/Linux yourself. The source code is in the 'Source' folder. It is a single file written in C#. You'll need to compile it using Mono. Once compiled make sure you execute it in the same folder the 'docTempleter.exe' is in.

	# Heading
	Features

	# Content
	The Documentation Templater comes with 4 elements you can use on each page. Firstly, there are Sections consisting of a heading and text content (like this one). You can leave out the heading to get the paragraphs on their own (like above), or you can leave out the content to get just a heading. Secondly, there is a HTML element allowing you to insert your own single-line HTML. Next are Tables. You can create tables with headings and rows. And finally there are Tabs. Each Tab can contain it's own Sections, HTML, Tables, or more Tabs!

	Additionally there is a nice sidenav on the left. You can put your text files into subdirectories to create dropdowns in the sidenav.

	Future

	# Content
	This is an early version! In the future the source code will be neatened up. There will be more elements added (multi-line HTML, images, buttons, etc). There will be more templates. And I may add an interface which allows you to easily change colour schemes for the built-in templates. Also, documentation for how-to-use the tool will be improved. Also, currently the sidenav naming is based on file names, this will change in the future. Ordering of content in the sidenav will also be improved (at the moment subdirectories are always put at the top, as you can see).
